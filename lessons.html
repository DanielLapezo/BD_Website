                    <p> <span class="Baby">Baby Driver</span> is a 2017 action film written and directed by Edgar
                        Wright. It stars Ansel Elgort as
                        a young, musically driven getaway driver seeking freedom from a life of crime with his lover
                        Debora (Lily James). Kevin Spacey, Jon Hamm, Eiza Gonz√°lez, Jamie Foxx and Jon Bernthal (among
                        others) appear in supporting roles. Eric Fellner and his Working Title Films partner Tim Bevan
                        produced Baby Driver in association with Big Talk Productions' Nira Park. Sony and TriStar
                        Pictures handled commercial distribution of the film. Baby Driver was financed through a
                        partnership between TriStar and Media Rights Capital.</p>
                    <p> The film is a longtime passion project Wright had developed for over two decades. He devised the
                        idea well in his youth, and his early directing experience furthermore shaped his ambitions for
                        Baby Driver. Originally based in Los Angeles, Wright later revised the film's setting to
                        Atlanta, integrating the city's ethos into an important storytelling device. Principal
                        photography took place in Atlanta over four months, from February to May 2016. Production
                        involved the planning of meticulously coordinated stunts, choreography, and in-camera shooting.
                        Critics have examined Baby Driver's subject matter in thematic studies of the film, with
                        emphasis on its use of color symbolism and focus on Baby's evolving morality.</p>
                    <p> Baby Driver premiered at the South by Southwest festival on March 11, 2017, and was released in
                        theaters in North America and the United Kingdom on June 28. It was well received by the media
                        for its craftsmanship, though the characterization and scriptwriting drew occasional criticism.
                        The National Board of Review selected Baby Driver as one of the top films of the year. It earned
                        $226 million globally, bolstered by positive word-of-mouth support and fatiguing interest in
                        blockbuster franchises. Baby Driver was a candidate for numerous awards, including three Academy
                        Awards (for Best Film Editing, Best Sound Editing and Best Sound Mixing), two BAFTAs, two
                        Critics' Choice Awards, and a Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Motion Picture Musical or Comedy
                        (Elgort), and won several other honors chiefly for technical achievement. The success of Baby
                        Driver has increased studio interest in producing a sequel.
